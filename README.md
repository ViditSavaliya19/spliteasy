# Split App

## ðŸ“± Project Spotlight: Spliteasy App

## What is Spliteasy? 
- Itâ€™s a sleek and efficient expense-splitting app that simplifies the process of dividing bills among friends, roommates, or travel companions.

## Tech Stack:
I harnessed the power of Jetpack Compose, Room (for local data storage), and the MVVM architecture to create a seamless user experience.

## Features:

## Compose UI: 
- The app boasts a modern and dynamic user interface, thanks to Jetpack Compose. Say goodbye to XML layouts and hello to declarative UI!
## Room Database: 
- I leveraged Room to manage local data storage, ensuring smooth data retrieval and persistence.
## MVVM Architecture: 
- By adopting the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, I achieved separation of concerns, making my codebase more maintainable and testable.

# ðŸŒŸ Key Takeaways:

## Less Code, More Magic: 
- Jetpack Compose allowed me to build complex UIs with minimal code. Itâ€™s like painting with pixels!
## LiveData & ViewModel: 
- LiveData kept my UI in sync with data changes, while ViewModel handled business logic elegantly.
